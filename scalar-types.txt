#### Two types of INTEGERS types 
unsigned/signed
u8/i8 - number stands for number of bits
usize/isize - max number
default = i32 (fastest number)

Decimal
Hex
Octal
Binary
Byte (rare)

underscors are ignored.

f32 (floats)
f64 (can be slow)

always have a number before .1 so = 0.1


#### BOOLEAN

true/false

### CHAR
is always 4 bytes.
specified using single quotes.
strings do not use characters.


### Compound types

// Tuple.
Stores multiple types
accessed by .syntax.

destructure the tuple like so: let (jet, car jeep) = (1, 2.3, 999);

max of 12 allowed.


// Array
multiple values of the same type. separated by the , or a semi-colon = let buf: [u8: 3] = [1,2,3];
index values with [] brackets;
arrays have a limit of 32 (vectors are used)
